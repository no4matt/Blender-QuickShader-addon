# Blender-QuickShader-addon

Once you have installed a zip repository, you should extract the files from the "Blender-QuickShader-addon-main" folder directly into the zip archive 
(or create another archive for these files). 
Now, this ZIP archive can already be added to Blender3D (should probably work on Blender version 3.0 or higher)
